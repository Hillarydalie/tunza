# TUNZA

This is a clone Awwwards. Awwwards is a web rating system to rate projects on the web. You will be able to do this, I wanted to test my skills in django by building a clone of awwwards using my knowledge in Django, a python framework. The application is accessible on both mobile and desktop version. Your comments and feedback are highly welcome.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help get you started and your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Also see deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following. 

```
- [x] Python version 3.6 - Readily available on any linux distro one may be using.
- [x] A code editor of your choice. I personally use webstorm, but other good freebee ones are Atom and VS code.
- [x] Terminal. We will run most of our apps from the terminal. Good knowledge in using the terminal is a plus. To start the terminal CTRL + ALT + T for linux.
- [x] Dependencies required will be installed in the next stage.
```

### Installing

This is a step by step series of instruction that will tell you how to get a development env running and any other installations required.

- [ ] Cloning the repository from the link. Open terminal and run the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/hillarydalie/tunza.git
```
- [ ] When the cloning is complete, enter to the folder cloned by running this command.

```
cd tunza/
```
- [ ] Create a virtual environment by running either of the two commands. <preffered_environment_name> replace this with your environment name.
```
*pip install virtualenv*, when complete then run *virtualenv <preffered_environment_name>* or *python3 -m venv virtual*
```
- [ ] Activate the virtual environment by running the following command.
```
source <preffered_environment_name>/bin/activate
```
- [ ] We will then install all the dependencies used in the project simply by running the requirements.txt file as follows.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- [ ] The last thing is to test and make sure everything is running fine. We shall use this command.
```
python3.6 manage.py runserver
```
Now we are ready to work on the project on our local server.


## Running the tests

An important aspect in python is writing tests to ensure our tests fail then writing code to ensure the tests pass. This has already been done. In order for you to run the tests you shall run the following code.

``` python3.6 manage.py tests```

Ensure all the tests ran and pass. If you need to add any features in the models, write the test, run the test to see if it fails, then write the code to ensure the test now passes. This is a good practise.
